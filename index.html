                <p>
                    Michael Phelps is a retired American swimmer and the most decorated Olympian of all time, with a total
                    of 28 medals to his name, including 23 gold medals. Phelps was born on June 30, 1985, in Baltimore,
                    Maryland, and was introduced to swimming at a young age by his sisters, who were also competitive
                    swimmers.
                    <br>
                    Phelps made his Olympic debut at the age of 15 in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where he became the youngest
                    American male swimmer to compete in the Olympics in 68 years. However, it was at the 2004 Athens
                    Olympics where Phelps first became a household name, winning six gold medals and setting several world
                    records.
                    <br>
                    Phelps continued to dominate the sport of swimming, breaking numerous world records and winning multiple
                    gold medals at the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympics. He retired from competitive swimming after the 2016
                    Rio Olympics, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest athletes of all time.
                    <br>
                    Aside from his incredible achievements in the pool, Phelps has also been open about his struggles with
                    mental health and has become an advocate for mental health awareness. He has also been involved in
                    various philanthropic endeavors, including the Michael Phelps Foundation, which promotes healthy and
                    active lifestyles for children.

                    <p>
                        Swimming is a popular recreational activity and a competitive sport that involves moving through
                        water by using various techniques, such as freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. It is
                        a low-impact exercise that provides a full-body workout and helps improve cardiovascular health,
                        muscle strength, and endurance. Swimming can also be a relaxing and therapeutic activity, providing
                        a sense of weightlessness and reducing stress on the body. Whether in a pool, lake, or ocean,
                        swimming is a versatile and enjoyable activity for people of all ages and skill levels.
